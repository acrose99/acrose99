## I like to program for fun, sometimes.
  ... And when I'm not programming I'm outside. 

Currently I'm focusing on web development across a variety of projects you can check out. Other then these projects, I'm miserable doing schoolwork.

* History of Computing (A big research project for Loyola Chicago)

* FoodSpector, a website about food inspections in Chicago

* Navy Seal Copypasta Generator, which lets people create their very own copypasta (and presets) really quickly.

* A website about corn, coming soon â„¢. 

* My own personal website, which no one will actually see, so I use it to experiment. I also write about stuff here, mostly as an escape from coding. 

Also, if you are a power mac user, check out my applescript repo.
